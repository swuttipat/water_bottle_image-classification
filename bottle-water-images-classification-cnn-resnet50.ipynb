The model will be trained on a dataset of water bottle images, with each image being labeled as Full water level, Half water level, or Overflowing. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify a given water bottle image based on its water level.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='dataset_description'></a>\n## Dataset Description: \nThe dataset consists of water bottle images that have been classified based on the level of water inside the bottle. There are three categories of images: Full water level, Half water level, and Overflowing. Each category contains a number of images of water bottles with the corresponding water level. The purpose of the dataset is to be used for an image classification problem, where a machine learning model is trained to classify the water level of a given water bottle image.\n\nThe dataset is intended to be used for training and testing a machine learning model for image classification. The model will be trained on the provided images, with each image being labeled as either Full water level, Half water level, or Overflowing. The goal of the model is to accurately classify a given water bottle image based on its water level.\n\nThe dataset consists of a number of water bottle images, each of which has been classified based on the water level inside the bottle. The images in the Full water level category show water bottles with the maximum possible amount of water inside, while the images in the Half water level category show water bottles with roughly half the maximum amount of water inside. The images in the Overflowing category show water bottles with more water inside than the maximum capacity of the bottle, resulting in water spilling out.\n\nThe dataset is likely to be useful for a variety of applications, such as developing automated systems for monitoring and managing water levels in containers or for use in a general image classification problem. The dataset may also be useful for research purposes, as it allows for the development and testing of machine learning models for image classification tasks.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='about_this_directory'></a>\n### About this directory\n\"This folder contains 308 images of water bottles with full water levels.

Create, train, and validate **CNN** model for water bottle images classification:\n    - Load dataset of water bottle images, and split it into training, validation, and testing sets.\n    - Design a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is suitable for image classification, and implement it using a deep learning TensorFlow.\n    - Train the CNN using the training set, and validate it using the validation set to check for overfitting.\n    - Evaluate the trained model using the testing set, and report its accuracy and other relevant metrics.\n\n2. Conduct the pre-trained model **ResNet50** into comparison with prior created model:\n    - Load the pre-trained ResNet50 model into the notebook and modify it to suit our specific image classification problem.\n    - Train the modified ResNet50 model using the same training set as the prior created model.\n    - Evaluate the performance of the modified ResNet50 model on the validation and testing sets, and compare it to the prior created model.\n\n3. Build the **GridSearchCV** searching through optimize parameter for the model:\n    - Choose the relevant hyperparameters that can be tuned for the CNN models, such as the learning rate, batch size, and optimizer algorithm.\n    - Implement a grid search to exhaustively search through the hyperparameter space and find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that yields the best performance on the validation set.\n    - Train the CNN model with the optimized hyperparameters and evaluate its performance on the testing set.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n<a id='load_dataset'></a>\n## Importing Data from the Directory\nI started by importing the data from the directory.

It is the most basic layer in TensorFlow and is used for constructing deep neural networks.\n\n- **Convolutional Layer**: A convolutional layer is used for image classification tasks. It uses filters to extract features from the input data.\n\n- **Dropout Layer**: A dropout layer is used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training.\n\n- **Batch Normalization** Layer: A batch normalization layer is used to normalize the inputs to a deep neural network. This helps to improve the training process and prevent overfitting.\n\n- **Pooling Layer**: A pooling layer is used to reduce the dimensionality of the input data. It is commonly used in image classification tasks to reduce the size of the input image.\n\n- **Flatten Layer**: A flatten layer is used to convert the input data from a high-dimensional array to a one-dimensional array. This is used in image classification tasks to prepare the input data for the fully connected layer.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='cnn_model'></a>\n### CNN model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam, SGD\n\n# set seed value for randomization\n# np.random.seed(42)\ntf.random.set_seed(42)\n\n# Build the model using a Convolutional Neural Network\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\n    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128,128,3)),\n    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),\n    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),\n    \n    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),\n    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),\n    \n    keras.layers.Conv2D(256, (3,3), activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Conv2D(256, (3,3), activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),\n    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),\n    \n    keras.layers.Flatten(),\n    keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),\n    keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),\n    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# See an overview of the model architecture and to debug issues related to the model layers.\nmodel.summary()\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-22T08:52:07.775542Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-02-22T08:52:07.776278Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-22T08:52:10.696324Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-22T08:52:07.776241Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-22T08:52:10.695219Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import time\nstart_time = time.time() #To show the training time\n\n# Train the model\n\n# set an early stopping mechanism\n# set patience to be tolerant against random validation loss increases\nearly_stopping = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=5)\n\n# history = model.fit(data, labels_one_hot, batch_size=32, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)\nhistory = model.fit(x=data,\n                    y=labels_one_hot,\n                    batch_size=256,\n                    epochs=100,\n                    validation_split=0.2,)\n#                     callbacks=[early_stopping])\n\n# Evaluate the model\nprint(\"Test accuracy: \", max(history.history['val_accuracy']))\n\n# Assign the trained model\nself_train_model = history\n\nend_time = time.time() #

Thus, a better approach is to start with a pre-trained model and fine-tune the model to adapt it to our dataset.\n* Overall, our CNN model was able to classify the water level of a given water bottle image with a high degree of accuracy (<85%).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='note'></a>\n# Note\n#### Improving a machine learning model can be achieved by using various techniques such as:\n* ✅ The techniques that I've applied\n* ❌ The technoques that I think it not neccesary.\n* 🤔 I don't know how to apply with codek and still figure out.\n\n1. **Feature Engineering**❌: Adding or modifying the features used in the model to better capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n\n2. **Model Selection**🤔: Choosing a different machine learning model that is more suitable for the data and the problem being solved.\n\n3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**✅: Adjusting the parameters of the machine learning model to improve its performance. This can be done manually or using techniques such as grid search or random search.\n\n4. **Ensemble Methods**🤔: Combining multiple models to create a more robust model. This can be done by averaging the predictions of multiple models or by training a separate model to make predictions based on the outputs of other models.\n\n5. **Regularization**✅: Adding a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n\n6. **Data Augmentation**✅: Increasing the size of the dataset by generating new data samples based on the original data. This can help to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.\n    - After predicting unseen test set model return an ugly result.\n    - To solve problem I will try clone an equally proportion labels dataset.\n\n7. **Early Stopping**✅: Stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation set starts to deteriorate. This can prevent overfitting and help to avoid the use of models that are too complex.\n\n8. **Transfer Learning**🤔: Reusing pre-trained models to reduce the time and computational resources required to train a new model.\n9. **Data Resampling**✅: Randomly adding or removing data from the dataset to balance the classes.
